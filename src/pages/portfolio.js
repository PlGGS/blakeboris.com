        <h2>Hello! I'm Blake, a 20 year old .NET, student developer that grew up in the Chicago suburbs. During middle school, friends of mine taught me how to make subtle changes in the text of videogames I was playing at the time. At the time, simply changing a few strings here and there completely blew my mind. Since then, I have come to understand the ins and outs of many computer science concepts that have allowed me to create a large amount of different applications, games, and mods. This website houses each and every one of my creations and provides insight into how I became the programmer I am today. (It is now very outdated though)</h2>
